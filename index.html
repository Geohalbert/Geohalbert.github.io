    <section id="about">
      <p>The Dogwood is a "homegrown" concept with a small touch of southern hospitality. Being from the south, as well as the Dogwood being our grandmother's favorite tree, we figured the iconic tree would be a perfect logo to showcase our "outdoor entertaining" concept throughout the bar. Natural stone and wood run throughout the spacious interior and brings you through floor to ceiling walk-throughs into gorgeous open air patios. The overall concept brings you to that back-home feeling among family and friends.  We like gathering with friends and family alike, so we built the Dogwood to have private spacious areas for events. Dogwood offers spaces closed by a glass partition with their own audio/video source, bathrooms, and complete privacy when needed.</p>

      <p>There are several other unique features of The Dogwood that separate us from the average bar. On our patio we have a large stage perfect for live music or video presentations. The conditioned interior space is very open and has a long, 80 foot bar for our guest.  Our state of the art audio and visual equipment are pre-wired for any event. The abundance of HD screens and our top notch sound system make The Dogwood a perfect place for game day as well as any and all sporting events.</p>

      <p>The food- Dogwood continues its passion for southern influence with high end food in a casual setting. Our menu ranges from Jalepeno Mac n Cheese, to chicken and waffle sliders, to our now famous Dogwood burger, which is topped with fried green tomatoes, applewood smoked bacon and white queso.  Our delicious food options can always be washed down with an ice cold Deep Eddy Sweet Tea Vodka poured straight from a frosted ice tap.</p>

      <p>Bottom line, we are just simple people looking to simply show everyone a good time. Come thirsty. Come Hungry.  Grab your friends and come check us out.</p>
